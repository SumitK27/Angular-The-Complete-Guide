## **Making your app Dynamic and Interactive**

Angular provides powerful tools to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. This section dives into techniques for dynamically applying styles and handling user interactions within your templates.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## **Dynamic Styling**

Imagine a button that changes color when clicked. Or elements that adjust their appearance based on data. Dynamic styling lets you achieve these effects by changing CSS rules based on your application's state or user interaction. Here are several ways to achieve this:

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Class Binding**

- Use the `[class]` attribute to dynamically add or remove CSS classes from an element.
- This is useful for applying a single class based on a condition.

```html
<button [class.active]="isActive">Click me!</button>
```

In this example, the `active` class is applied to the button only when isActive is `true`.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Style Binding**

- Use the `[style]` attribute to dynamically set inline styles on an element.
- This is useful for applying a single style based on a condition.

```html
<button [style.backgroundColor]="isActive ? 'blue' : 'red'">Click me!</button>
```

In this example, the button's background color changes to blue when isActive is `true` and red when it's `false`.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **NgClass Directive**

- Use the `ngClass` directive to apply multiple classes based on conditions.
- This is useful for applying multiple classes based on different conditions.

```html
<button [ngClass]="{active: isActive, disabled: isDisabled}">Click me!</button>
```

In this example, the button applies the `active` class when isActive is `true` and the `disabled` class when isDisabled is `true`.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **NgStyle Directive**

- Use the `ngStyle` directive to apply multiple styles based on conditions.
- This is useful for applying multiple styles based on different conditions.

```html
<button [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: isActive ? 'blue' : 'red', color: isDisabled ? 'gray' : 'black'}">Click me!</button>
```

In this example, the button changes its background color to blue when isActive is `true` and red when it's `false`. It also changes the text color to gray when isDisabled is `true` and black when it's `false`.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Other Techniques**

- **Host Binding:** Use the `@HostBinding` decorator to bind properties to host elements.
- **Renderer2:** Use Angular's Renderer2 service to manipulate elements directly.
- **ElementRef:** Use Angular's ElementRef service to access the host element in your component.
- **ViewEncapsulation:** Control how styles are encapsulated in your components.
- **Global Styles:** Apply global styles to your application using the `styles.css` file.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## **Two-Way Data Binding**

Two-way data binding is a powerful feature that allows you to bind data in both directions between a component and its template. This means that changes in the template can update the component, and changes in the component can update the template. 

Imagine a text input field that updates a variable in your component as you type. Two-way data binding makes this possible with the `[(ngModel)]` directive.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Using ngModel**

- Use the `[(ngModel)]` directive to create two-way data binding between an input element and a component property.
- This is useful for updating data in real-time as users interact with your application.

```html
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name" />
<p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>
```

In this example, the `name` property in the component is updated in real-time as you type in the input field. The changes are reflected in the paragraph element below.

Note: To use `[(ngModel)]`, you need to import the `FormsModule` in your imports array in the `@NgModule` decorator of your module.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Using Signals**

Model signals provide a declarative way to establish two-way binding between a component and its template.

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  import: [FormsModule],
  template: `
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
    <p>Hello, {{ name() }}!</p>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  name = signal('');
}
```

In this example, the `name` signal establishes two-way binding between the input field and the paragraph element. Changes in the input field update the paragraph element in real-time.

**Key Points:**

- Model signals simplify two-way binding syntax.
- They provide better performance and reactivity compared to ngModel.
- Combine with other signal features for complex data management.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Model signals are part of Angular's Signals API, available from version 17.
- Explore other signal features like computed and effect for advanced scenarios.
- Consider using form libraries or custom form solutions for complex forms.

**Benefits of Model Signals:**

- Improved performance
- Simpler syntax
- Better reactivity
- Integration with other signal features

### **FormsModule**

The `FormsModule` is a built-in Angular module that provides two-way data binding capabilities using the `[(ngModel)]` directive as we saw in [using ngModel](#using-ngmodel) section.

It also provides other form-related features like form validation, form submission, and form controls. To use the `FormsModule`, you need to import it in your module's imports array:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [FormsModule]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

By importing the `FormsModule`, you can use two-way data binding and other form-related features in your Angular application.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Listening to Form Submission Event**

You can listen to the form submission event using the `(ngSubmit)` directive. This allows you to execute a function in your component when the form is submitted.

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name" name="name" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In this example, the `onSubmit` function is called when the form is submitted. You can access the form data in the component and perform any necessary actions.

## **Directives in Angular**

### **What is Directive**

In Angular, a directive is a class that adds behavior to elements in your application. They are essentially instructions for Angular to manipulate the DOM. Angular comes with built-in directives like `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngModel`, but you can also create custom directives to extend Angular's functionality.

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Types of Directives**

- **Component Directives:** These are the most common type of directives and represent a component.
- **Attribute Directives:** These modify the behavior of existing elements.
- **Structural Directives:** These modify the DOM structure by adding, removing, or replacing elements. 

**[‚¨ÜÔ∏è back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Creating Custom Directives**

Let's create a custom directive named highlight that adds a highlight class to an element:

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {
    el.nativeElement.classList.add('highlight');
  }
}
```

In this example, the `HighlightDirective` class adds the `highlight` class to the element it's applied to. You can use this directive in your templates like this:

```html
<p appHighlight>Highlight me!</p>
```

This will apply the `highlight` class to the paragraph element.

**Key Points:**

- Directives are a powerful way to extend HTML's capabilities.
- They can modify elements' behavior, appearance, and structure.
- Custom directives promote code reusability.
- Angular provides built-in directives for common tasks.
- By understanding directives, you can create more dynamic and interactive Angular applications.
