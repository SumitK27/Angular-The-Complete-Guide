## **Introduction to Modules**

### **What are Modules?**

Modules are a way to organize your Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They help you manage the complexity of large applications by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Prior to Standalone Components (Angular 16 and earlier), Angular applications were structured using modules. Modules are still an essential part of Angular applications, but they are now used to group related components, services, and other features together.

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Types of Modules**

There are several types of modules in Angular:

1. **Root Module**: The root module is the main module of an Angular application. It is typically defined in a file called `app.module.ts` and bootstrapped when the application is loaded. The root module imports other modules and declares the components, services, and other features of the application.
2. **Feature Module**: Feature modules are used to group related components, services, and other features together. They are typically defined in separate files and imported into the root module or other feature modules. Feature modules help you organize your application into smaller, more manageable pieces.
3. **Shared Module**: Shared modules are used to share components, directives, pipes, and other features across multiple modules in an application. They are typically defined in a file called `shared.module.ts` and imported into other modules that need to use the shared features.
4. **Lazy-Loaded Module**: Lazy-loaded modules are used to load parts of an application on demand. They are typically defined in separate files and loaded asynchronously when needed. Lazy-loaded modules help you improve the performance of your application by only loading the parts that are required.
5. **Routing Module**: Routing modules are used to configure the routes of an application. They are typically defined in a file called `app-routing.module.ts` and imported into the root module. Routing modules help you define the navigation paths of your application and map them to components and other features.

More information about modules can be found in the [Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/ngmodules).

### **Built-in Modules**

Angular provides several built-in modules that you can use in your applications:

| NgModule              | Import it from              | Why you use it                                                                                      | Example                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `CommonModule`        | `@angular/common`           | Provides common directives, pipes, and other features used in Angular applications.                 | *ngIf, *ngFor, DatePipe |
| `FormsModule`         | `@angular/forms`            | Provides form directives and services for building forms in Angular applications.                   | ngModel, ngForm         |
| `HttpClientModule`    | `@angular/common/http`      | Provides HTTP client services for making requests to a server in Angular applications.              | HttpClient, HttpHeaders |
| `RouterModule`        | `@angular/router`           | Provides routing services for configuring the routes of an Angular application.                     | RouterModule, Routes    |
| `BrowserModule`       | `@angular/platform-browser` | Provides services for running Angular applications in a web browser.                                | BrowserModule           |
| `ReactiveFormsModule` | `@angular/forms`            | Provides reactive form directives and services for building reactive forms in Angular applications. | FormGroup, FormBuilder  |

The above table is from the Angular documentation. You can find more information about built-in modules in the [Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/ngmodules/frequent).

### **Creating a Module**

Imagine you have an Angular application with multiple components, services, and other features. You can create a module to group related components, services, and other features together.

Here's how you can create a module in Angular:

1. Create a new file for your module, e.g., `my-new-module.module.ts`.
2. Define a new module using the `@NgModule` decorator.
3. Import the necessary Angular modules, components, services, and other features.
4. Export the module so that it can be imported and used in other parts of your application.
5. Import the module in your main application module (usually `app.module.ts`).
6. Use the module in your application by importing and using its components, services, and other features.

Here's an example of a simple module in Angular:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { MyComponent } from './my-component.component';
import { MyService } from './my-service.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule],
  providers: [MyService],
  exports: [MyComponent]
})
export class MyNewModule { }
```

In this example, we define a new module called `MyNewModule` that contains a component `MyComponent` and a service `MyService`. We import the `CommonModule` from Angular, declare the `MyComponent`, provide the `MyService`, and export the `MyComponent` so that it can be used in other parts of the application.

### **Understanding NgModule Configuration**

The `@NgModule` decorator is used to define a module in Angular. It takes a metadata object that specifies how the module should be configured. Here are some of the key properties of the metadata object:

- `declarations`: An array of components, directives, and pipes that belong to the module. These components, directives, and pipes are private by default and can only be used within the module.
- `imports`: An array of other modules that this module depends on. This allows you to use the components, directives, and pipes from the imported modules in your module.
- `exports`: An array of components, directives, and pipes that should be made public and can be used in other modules that import this module.
- `providers`: An array of services that should be available to all components in the module. These services are registered with the Angular injector and can be injected into components using dependency injection.
- `bootstrap`: The root component that should be bootstrapped when the module is loaded. This is typically the main component of the application.

### **Using Modules in Angular**

Once you have created a module, you can import and use it in other parts of your application. To import a module, you simply need to add an `import` statement at the top of the file where you want to use the module.

Here's an example of how you can import and use a module in Angular:

```typescript
import { MyNewModule } from './my-new-module.module';

@NgModule({
  imports: [MyNewModule]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

In this example, we import the `MyNewModule` module and add it to the `imports` array of the `AppModule`. This makes the components, services, and other features of the `MyNewModule` module available for use in the `AppModule`.

## **Migrating Standalone Components to Modules in Angular**

### **Understanding the Need for Modules**

While standalone components offer flexibility, using modules to organize your Angular application becomes essential for larger projects. Modules provide a structured way to group related components, directives, pipes, and services, improving code maintainability and testability.

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Steps to Migrate Standalone Components to Modules**

#### **1. Create a new module for your component**

There are two ways to create a new module for your component:

- **Using the Angular CLI**: You can use the Angular CLI to generate a new module file using the following command:

  ```bash
  ng generate module <your-module-name>
  ```
  This creates a new directory `src/app/your-module-name/` with the module file `your-module-name.module.ts`.

- **Manually**: You can create a new module file manually by creating a new TypeScript file with a `.module.ts` extension.
- **Example**:

  ```bash
  cd src/app
  touch your-module-name.module.ts
  ```

#### **2. Convert Standalone Components to Module Components**

To use standalone components in modules, you need to convert them to module components by removing the `standalone` property from the `@Component` decorator and removing the `imports` array. This is because standalone components and modules are rival concepts.

```typescript
// Before (standalone)
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: '...',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ /* ... */ ]
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

```typescript
// After (module component)
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: '...'
})
export class MyComponent {}
```

Alternatively, you can use standalone components in the `imports` array of the module to use them in the module.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { MyComponent } from './my-component.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [MyComponent] // Standalone component used in the module
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **3. Declare Components in the Module:**

Import the converted components into the module and add them to the declarations array of the module:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { MyComponent } from './my-component.component';
import { MyOtherComponent } from './my-other-component.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyComponent, MyOtherComponent]
})
export class MyFeatureModule {}
```

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **4. Adding Entry Components to the Module:**

If you have components that should be compiled and created dynamically, add them to the entryComponents array of the module:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { MyComponent } from './my-component.component';
import { MyOtherComponent } from './my-other-component.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyComponent], // Module component
  imports: [MyOtherComponent], // Standalone component used in the module
  entryComponents: [MyComponent] // Entry component
})
export class MyFeatureModule {}
```

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **5. Bootstrap the Root Module:**

The root module is the entry point for your application. Use platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule() to bootstrap the root module:

```typescript
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

## **Module Components vs Standalone Components**

Angular offers two primary approaches to structuring applications: modules and standalone components. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.**

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Module Components**:

Module-based components are traditional components that belong to a specific module. They provide a structured way to organize and manage components, directives, and pipes within an application.

#### **Pros:**

- **Organization:** Encapsulates related components, directives, and pipes into logical units.
- **Dependency Management:** Clearly defines dependencies between modules.
- **Lazy Loading:** Improves initial load time by loading modules on demand.
- **Testability:** Provides a clear structure for testing.
- **Code Sharing:** Enables sharing components and services across multiple modules.

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Cons:**

- **Boilerplate:** Requires additional setup and configuration.
- **Complexity:** Can introduce complexity for small applications.
- **Potential for Over-Engineering:** Can lead to over-compartmentalization if not used judiciously.

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### **Standalone Components**:

Standalone components are self-contained units of UI that don't require being declared within a module. They offer a simplified development experience and are ideal for small, focused components.

#### **Pros:**

- **Simplicity:** Reduced boilerplate and configuration.
- **Rapid Development:** Faster to create and iterate on components.
- **Flexibility:** Components can be used independently without modules.
- **Better Tree-Shaking:** Potentially smaller bundle sizes due to more granular control over imports.

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

#### **Cons:**

- **Organization:** Lack of structure for larger applications.
- **Dependency Management:** Can become challenging for complex dependencies.
- **Code Reusability:** Sharing components between different parts of the application might be less straightforward.
- **Testability:** Requires additional setup for testing standalone components.

**[⬆️ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## **When to Use Which**

- **Small to Medium-Sized Applications:** Standalone components might be sufficient.
- **Large-Scale Applications:** Modules provide better organization and maintainability.
- **Feature-Based Development:** Create separate modules for different features.
- **Lazy Loading:** Modules are essential for lazy loading.
